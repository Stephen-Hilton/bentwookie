# Learnings
AI Coding Agents should append / update the bullet points below.

- Start by reading and understanding all markdown files in `tasks/global/*.md`
- Learnings in this file should supercede `tasks/global/learnings.md` but not `tasks/global/interfaces.md`
- For terminal-based games, `rich` + `blessed` libraries provide visually appealing UI with keyboard input support
- When planning games, define file implementation order based on dependency graph (constants first, main.py last)
- Include a visual ASCII mockup of the UI layout in game plans to clarify the intended look
