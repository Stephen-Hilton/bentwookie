I just learned there is a claude-code python SDK, and would like to massively rewrite the BentWookie project.

The goals are the same: 
- create a looping AI coding agent that always monitors a queue for work, in phases (plan,dev,test,deploy,verify,done)
- an easy to use input (cli, also simple WebUI) 

The approach I would like to try is very different:
- run the loop inside python, giving better prework, monitoring, and postwork abilities
- use sqlite DB for better data fidelity and management
- use docs/ folder for large output.md files

I think the required tables look like:
- Project = columns [prjid, prjname, prjversion, prjpriority, prjphase, prjdesc, prjtouchts] 
    - prjid is primary key
    - prjversion = [poc, mvp, v1, v1.1, etc.]
    - prjphase = [dev, qa, uat, prod, etc.]
    - prjtouchts = timestamp for last time record was touched (inserted / updated / verified)
    
- Request = columns [ prjid, reqid, reqname, reqtype, reqstatus, reqphase, reqprompt, reqpriority, reqcodedir, reqdocpath, reqtouchts  ]  
    - Project prjid (pk) -- 1:M -- Request prjid (fk)
    - reqtype = [bug_fix, new_feature, enhancement, etc.]
    - reqphase = [plan, dev, test, deploy, verify, document, complete, etc.]
    - reqstatus = [tbd, wip, done, err, tmout]
    - reqcodedir = directory in which to sandbox code changes (all changes in that dir, no changes out of that dir)
    - reqdocpath = path to any long-form markdown file, such as Implementation plans, summaries, etc. 

- Infrastructure = columns [ prjid, infid, infprovider, inftype, infval, infnote ]
    - Project prjid (pk) -- 1:M -- Infrastructure prjid (fk)
    - infprovider = [ local, container, aws, gcp, azure, etc.]
    - inftype = [compute, storage, queue, access, ui, etc.]
    - infval = options for each provider/type, i.e., aws_lambda, aws_ec2, aws_beanstalk, etc.

- Learnings = columns [ prjid, lrnid, lrndesc, lrntouchts ]
    - Project prjid (pk) -- 1:M -- Request prjid (fk)`
    - lrnid = AI provided learnings while working on a project, 255 character len max
