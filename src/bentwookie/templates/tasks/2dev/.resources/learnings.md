# Development Stage Learnings

This file contains learnings specific to the development stage. Stage learnings supersede global learnings (except for interfaces).

## Key Learnings

- Always check for existing similar implementations before writing new code
- Follow the project's existing patterns for error handling and logging
- Use the Standard Data Format (SDF) for all data structures
- Write code that is testable - consider test cases during development
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer composition over inheritance when designing components

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't introduce breaking changes without documenting them
- Don't hardcode configuration values - use environment variables
- Don't ignore type hints if the project uses them
- Don't skip input validation at system boundaries

## Best Practices

- Run linting before marking development as complete
- Keep commits atomic and well-documented
- Update any relevant inline documentation
